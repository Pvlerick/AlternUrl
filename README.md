AlternUrl
=========

An utility Url class for .NET

This is still work in progress, I have a lot in mind and not so much time :-)

TODO:
- Normalization
- Port the Url code to F#, leave the test code in C#
- Split into two classes: AbsoluteUrl and RelativeUrl instead of only one class with ugly NotSupported exceptions
- Refactor test and use AutoFixture
- Create a build script (run unit tests and code analysis)
- Make a NuGet package on stable enough
