AlternUrl
=========

An utility Url class for .NET

This is still work in progress, I have a lot in mind and not so much time :-)

TODO:
- Normalization
- Split into two classes: AbsoluteUrl and RelativeUrl instead of only one class with ugly NotSupported exceptions
- Refactor test (use AutoFixture?)
- Create a build script (run unit tests and code analysis)
- Make a NuGet package once stable enough
